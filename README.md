# slop-loader

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/slop-loader)](https://npmjs.org/package/slop-loader)

> Prompt-to-code loader for Next.js/Webpack. Import LLM outputs as build-time content, storing raw prompts in your repository as sources.

`slop-loader` lets you **write natural-language prompt files** like `Header__prompt.tsx` as source files, and **get importable components generated at build-time** by the LLM of your choice.

No copy-pasting code, no AI noise polluting your sources. Just `import Header from "./Header__prompt.tsx"` and render `<Header />`.

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> Probably only works in Next.js **with Webpack**. Untested in Turbopack and other Webpack contexts. Depending on how fast your model inference provider is, builds may be slow. See [Limitations](#limitations) below for more details.

## Features

* Supports any file types your existing Next.js Webpack config already supports (e.g. `.js`, `.tsx`, `.css`, etc.).
* Regenerates files when prompts change; supports  `next dev` hot reload on prompt changes.
* Supports incremental prompting (previous version of file is sent to LLM along with new prompt).
* Supports direct editing of LLM-generated code (generations are written to the [`.slop` directory](#slop-dir)) with hot reload.

## Usage

1. Install the loader and the AI SDK provider of your choice.

    ```bash
    npm install slop-loader @ai-sdk/openai # alternatively, `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`
    ```

1. Update your Next.js app's config to enable the loader.

    ```ts
    // next.config.ts

    import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'; // Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set
    import type { NextConfig } from "next";
    import path from "path";

    const openaiModel = openai('gpt-4-turbo');

    const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
      // ...
      typescript: {
        // This is necessary for builds to work, if you're generating `.ts` or `.tsx` files
        ignoreBuildErrors: true,
      },
      webpack: (config) => {
        config.module.rules.push({
          // This is the only supported import pattern for now; make sure your `test` matches exactly.
          test: /__prompt\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+$/,
          use: [
            {
              loader: "slop-loader",
              options: {
                // Any `LanguageModel` created by Vercel's AI SDK will work.
                model: openaiModel,
              },
            },
          ],
        });

        return config;
      },
      // ...
    };

    export default nextConfig;
    ```

1. Optionally, update your VS Code, ESLint and TypeScript configs to make your IDE more cooperative.

    <details>
    <summary>Example <code>.vscode/settings.json</code>, <code>eslint.config.mjs</code>, <code>tsconfig.json</code></summary>

    ```json
    // .vscode/settings.json - display prompt files as Markdown

    {
      "files.associations": {
        "*__prompt.*": "markdown"
      }
    }
    ```

    ```js
    // eslint.config.mjs - don't run ESLint on prompt files

    const eslintConfig = [
      ...compat.extends("next/core-web-vitals", "next/typescript"),
      {
        ignores: ["**/*__prompt.*"],
      },
    ];
    ```

    ```json
    // tsconfig.json - don't typecheck prompt files

    {
      "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*__prompt.ts", "**/*__prompt.tsx"]
    }
    ```
    </details>

1. Create files by prompting.

    ```md
    <!--- app/components/Header__prompt.tsx --->

    A React Header component that takes in a single `brand` prop. The brand displays in the upper-left in large text.

    On the right hand side, link to "GitHub" with href "https://github.com/nathanhleung/slop-loader".

    The Header should have fixed positioning and have 1rem margin from the top, left and right edges of the viewport. Height should be auto based on content. The Header itself should have 1rem padding on the y-axis and 3rem on the x-axis. The background should be translucent white with 9999px border-radius corners (circular sides) and backdrop-blur. The text should be black.
    ```

    ```md
    <!--- app/components/Background__prompt.tsx --->

    cool web3 background, absolutely positioned, liquid gradients, black, blue, purple, red, green (but not straight web colors, should have some cohesion) heavily blurred, low z-index, no harsh edges, no majority one color.

    The background should fill the entire screen.
    ```

1. Import prompt files directly into your app.

    > 💡 **Tip**
    >
    > Add `@ts-expect-error slop-loader` above your imports if TypeScript is giving you import errors.

    ```tsx
    // app/page.tsx

    // @ts-expect-error slop-loader
    import Header from "./components/Header__prompt";
    // @ts-expect-error slop-loader
    import Background from "./components/Background__prompt";

    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <>
          <Header brand="My App" />
          <Background />
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

1. Run the Next.js dev server and visit http://localhost:3000.

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    > ⚠️ **Warning**
    >
    > On first load, the build may take a while.


1. View generated outputs in the `.slop` directory.

    ```tsx
    // .slop/app/components/Background__meta-llama-llama-3-3-70b-instruct-free__baa00b2fe9684c8e.tsx

    "use client";
    import * as React from "react";

    /**
     * This file was proudly generated by slop-loader.
     *
     * Generated at: 2025-04-19T04:12:10.618Z
     */

    const Background = () => {
      return (
        <div
          style={{
            position: "absolute",
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            width: "100%",
            height: "100vh",
            zIndex: -1,
            background:
              "linear-gradient(90deg, #000000 0%, #03055B 30%, #3500FF 50%, #FF0000 70%, #00FF00 100%)",
            backdropFilter: "blur(10px)",
          }}
        >
          <div
            style={{
              position: "absolute",
              top: 0,
              left: 0,
              width: "100%",
              height: "100%",
              background:
                "radial-gradient(at 50% 50%, #6c5ce7 20%, transparent 50%), radial-gradient(at 30% 30%, #ff3737 20%, transparent 50%), radial-gradient(at 70% 70%, #34A85A 20%, transparent 50%)",
              backgroundSize: "200px 200px",
              opacity: 0.5,
              filter: "blur(50px)",
            }}
          />
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default Background;
    ```

1. <a id="slop-dir"></a>Continue by either (a) editing the source prompt in your `<filename>__prompt.<ext>` file or (b) editing the generated files directly in the `.slop` directory created at your project's root.

    > ⚠️ **Warning**
    >
    > Upon any change of either type, the Next.js dev server will reload the file. The rebuild may take a while due to inference time; the circular Next.js logo in the bottom left will animate if generation is in progress.

    > 💡 **Tip**
    >
    > By default, when you edit the source prompt, the previously-generated version of the file will be sent to the LLM to use as a base for the new generation. To start over, include the string `!!START OVER` somewhere in your prompt, or delete the content of the previously generated file in `.slop`. 

    > ⚠️ **Warning**
    >
    > If you want to import a shared component into a generated file in `.slop`, imports should be relative to the location of the original source prompt file, not the generated file. This will probably show an error in your IDE; ignore it.

1. When you're satisfied with your changes, commit the `.slop` directory to source control to save LLM outputs (and your edits, if applicable) for future builds.

    > 💡 **Tip**
    >
    > Or not, if you want a surprise every time you run `next build`.

    > 💡 **Tip**
    >
    > Running into weird build errors? Try deleting `.next` and restarting.

## How It Works

`slop-loader` hooks into file imports of the form `<filename>__prompt.<ext>`, but instead of immediately importing, it sends the prompt file content to an LLM for generation at build/bundle time. Then, it hands the output off to the standard Next.js build process.

We're able to hook into the standard Next.js build process after initial code generation because the extension of the imported file `<filename>__prompt.<ext>` is still `.<ext>`. So the default Next.js Webpack loaders which handle `.<ext>` files take over automatically. For practical purposes, this means that `slop-loader` supports generating and importing any file types that your existing Webpack config already supports.

The loader's [default prompt](./src/generate.ts#L13) includes extra context about the project (e.g. `package.json`, directory structure) and encourages consistent outputs (e.g. `default` exports for React components).

The loader's `option`s supports using the LLM of your choice, as long as it's configured with [Vercel's AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/). It also supports [customization of the default prompt](./src/generate.ts#L90) with your own instructions.

## Why

LLMs are inundating our source repos with a tsunami of generated slop, making it difficult to tell what code is disposable or not.

`slop-loader` lets developers store their carefully engineered LLM prompts as source files next to their other source code, and separates them from the generated slop that comes out. Essentially, we're storing **prompts as code**.

## Limitations

* Only tested in Next.js Webpack contexts. Untested in Turbopack and other Webpack contexts.
* Prompted files take on the order of 5–10 seconds each to generate. Large projects may take a while to build if not storing `.slop` directory in version control. Changes to prompts may take a while to be fully processed.
* Since code is generated from prompts at build-time, there are no IDE type hints for `<filename>__prompt.<ext>` files.
* `<filename>__prompt.tsx?` files don't pass type checking, so build-time type checking must be disabled for Next.js builds to work.
* Generated code in `.slop` should import files with paths that are relative to the original `<filename>__prompt.<ext>` file location; IDE import hints will show an error even though the import will work at build-time.

## API

Loader options are specified below. They can be passed to the loader in your Webpack config, e.g.

```ts
{
  test: /__prompt\.[0-9a-zA-Z]+$/,
  use: [
    {
      loader: "slop-loader",
      options: {
        model: "<insert your model here>",
        getPrompt: "<define your getPrompt function here>"
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

### `model`

Type: `import("ai").LanguageModel`

A `LanguageModel` from Vercel's AI SDK.

### `getPrompt`

Type: `(ctx: { currentDate: Date; filepath: string; sourcePrompt: string; rootContext: string; previousGeneration: string; }) => string`

A function which takes in a `PromptContext` (containing the current date, the path of the file to generate `filepath`, the `sourcePrompt` from the `<filename>__prompt.<ext>` file, the project root directory `rootContext`, and the previously generated file `previousGeneration`) and returns the final, combined (i.e. system + source) prompt for the file to send to the LLM. 

If you'd like to use a custom system prompt, this is where you'll want to define it. Make sure you append the `sourcePrompt` afterwards.
