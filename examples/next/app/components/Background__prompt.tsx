Absolutely positioned, inset 0 background with grid-like dot pattern created by CSS radial-gradient, repeated. Dots should be light grey (#aaa) against white and not spaced too closely together, about 1rem apart. The background should fill the entire screen and should have a -1 z-index as to not cover the rest of the screen.
