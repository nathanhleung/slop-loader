Fixed positioned, inset 0, white background with grid-like dot pattern created by CSS radial-gradient, repeated.

Dots should be light grey (#aaa) against a white background and not spaced too closely together, about 1rem apart.

The background should fill the entire screen and should have a -1 z-index as to not cover the rest of the screen.
