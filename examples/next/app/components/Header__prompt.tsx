A React Header component that takes in a single `brand` prop. The brand displays in the upper-left in large text.

On the right hand side, link to "GitHub" with href "https://github.com/nathanhleung/slop-loader".

The Header should have fixed positioning and have 1rem margin from the top, left and right edges of the viewport. The Header should be translucent white, 50% opacity with backdrop-blur and have 9999px border-radius. Height should be auto based on content. The Header itself should have 1rem padding on the y-axis and 3rem on the x-axis. The text should be black. Add a 1px #aaa solid border.
