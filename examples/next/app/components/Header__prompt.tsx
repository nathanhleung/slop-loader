A React Header component that takes in a single `brand` prop. The brand displays in the upper-left in large text.

The Header should have fixed positioning and have 1rem margin from the top, left and right edges of the viewport. The Header should be translucent white, spanning the viewport width minus margin, 50% opacity with backdrop-blur and have 9999px border-radius. Height should be auto based on content. The Header itself should have 1rem padding on the y-axis and 3rem on the x-axis. The text should be black. Add a 1px #aaa solid border.

On the right hand side, a primary LinkButton to "GitHub" with href "https://github.com/nathanhleung/slop-loader" which open in a new tab.
