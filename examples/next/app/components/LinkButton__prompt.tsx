A Link button component that takes in four props "href", "target", "variant" and "children". "href" and "target" are strings passed to the underlying <a>, "variant" is "primary" | "secondary" (default "primary"), "children" is a ReactNode.

Children should be centered, if text. Text should be bold. Rounded corners with 9999px border radius. 0.5rem y-axis and 1rem x-axis padding. 

"primary" variant should have black background with white text.
"secondary" variant should have white background with black text.

As default variant in primary, when no variant is passed the button should have a black background white white text.
